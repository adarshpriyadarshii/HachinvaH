                <p class="text">The worship of these types of idols are usually seen in the Tulu nadu regions of Karnataka. Bhootaâ€™s are referred as ethereal spirits or demi gods that protect the people of the village from evil. It is a prehistoric ritual form of worship that exists within the Tulu speaking community of people.The Bhoota cults are confined to the Dakshina Kannada region and certain areas of Uttara Kannada districts. The Bhootas are considered as nature spirits much like the yakshas which are believed to demand propitiation from local people in return for protection of cattle and warding off disease. Worship is often not conducted with an icon but through staged rituals. The cult belongs to an ancient form of worship. The sculptures are found in temples dedicated to Hindu gods. However, they do not play any role in the ceremonies of the cult. The type of wood used is the halsa or the untreated jack wood, carved and painted. The bhoota sculptures were installed into the floors of the shrine. The carving of bhoota figures is a hereditary profession. Famous amongst the bhoota figures are the ones that are found at a bhoota shrine in Mekkekattu near Udupi.</p>
