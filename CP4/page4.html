                <p class="text">The inspiration of this great southern art form traces back to around 1600 AD. Their dense artistic work along with their vibrant color and rich surface make these Thanjavur paintings distinguishable from the other forms of Indian paintings. Tanjore painting is an exquisite traditional art form and has a very rich heritage. This classical painting style of South India originated from the town of Thanjavur. This art form flourished way back about 1600AD by the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the reign of Vijayanagar Rayas. These paintings are made up of rich and vibrant colors with glittering gold overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work. They are also embedded with glass beads and pieces or precious gem stones. The dense composition, surface richness and vibrant colors distinguish tanjore paintings from other forms. The subjects of paintings are mostly Hindu gods, goddesses and saints among these one is Annapoorna tanjore painting. Annapoorna is derived from the combination of two words “anna” which means food and “poorna” which means complete or perfect. Annapoorna devi depicted in the painting is worshipped as the goddess of food. There are also many instances from the history when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religions and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings. Nowadays Tanjore paintings are greatly preferred by the art lovers to adorn their walls especially for South Indian people these paintings have become a part of souvenirs for festive occasions. These paintings are also used to decorate the puja rooms in residences, temples, hotels etc. Meticulously crafted Tanjore paintings are unique in their own. They are bright and colourful and very attractive. Moreover the distinctive feature that keeps them apart from the other paintings are the embossing made over the sketches with gemstones and also the work that gives them a three dimensional effect. The impact in the darkened room is that of the glowing presence.</p>
