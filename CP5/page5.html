This art was famous by the name Tholu Bommalata and now the ancient form of this Art has been transformed in to Craft Art by the way of interior designing and giving livelihood opportunities in the region. Primarily these craft items are made with goat leather. The main reason behind it is that the process of this Art is done traditionally using naturally available material, natural dye colours as well as iron frames. This professional art is being made by the Artists using traditional tools with skilled workmanship by designing the pictures and designs on the leather and then dying with beautiful colours. The carving, holing and crafting as well as designing on leather give looks like living things. At present the items made through this craft are Lamp Shades, Paintings, Wall hangings, Door hangings, partitions and modern puppets which are very popularly used in interior designing now a days.
